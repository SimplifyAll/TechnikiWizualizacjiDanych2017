It's the hand of the SWAT TEAM CHIEF; he's wearing a bulletproof vest, gloves, facemask, and has an uzi in his hand. He's not alone. There are seven SWAT team members. SWAT CHIEF 1 (softly) You don't make a sound; you nod 'yes' or you shake 'no' - got it? MATHILDA nods 'yes'. She quickly understands what's going on. CHIEF 1 Is he alone? She nods 'yes'. CHIEF 1 Does he expect you? She nods 'yes'. CHIEF 1 Do you have keys to the apartment? She nods 'yes'. CHIEF 1 think for a moment. CHIEF 1 Do you have some kind of code - a way of knocking - so that he knows it's you? She nods 'yes'. She raises her arm and knocks on the wall: two knocks, three knocks, two knocks. The code is wrong. Nonetheless CHIEF 1 is satisfied. He signals the group to take position. SWAT 2 takes MATHILDA down the stairwell and stays with her. SWAT 2 Don't be afraid.","unknown","1"

In the hallway, the rest of the SWAT TEAM don't have time to say anything. (Off) We hear the slaughter commence: shots and cries for twenty seconds. Then the door opens again apparently by itself. There are three corpses in the hallway of the apartment; meanwhile SWAT 2 radios for back-up. SWAT 2 (into walkie-talkie) We got men down here! Send back-up immediately! MATHILDA reaches into her shopping bag and pulls-out a gun that she holds by her side. On the side of the door we see LEON's periscope; he's watching the three SWATS in the hallway.
